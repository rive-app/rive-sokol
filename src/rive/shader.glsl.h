    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader rive_debug_contour = sg_make_shader(rive_debug_contour_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));
        sg_shader rive_shader = sg_make_shader(rive_shader_shader_desc(sg_query_backend()));

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {

            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]


    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params':
